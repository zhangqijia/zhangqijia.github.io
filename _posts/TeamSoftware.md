# week3

## capturing requirements

1. save user stories
2. track stories in Kanban board

## presenting stories to your client

1. organising your stories:
   1. do they naturally cluster in groups?
2. mandatory, desirable, optional
3. show a changing story list to your client, **highlight changes!**

#### ?? mock-ups???

## Ethics in software engineering

1. because we store personal information, we need 

### GDPR  

1. give user deceleration

# week4

## Database design1

- **Modelling a database**
  - ERD s
  - relations

- Constructing
  - UML class

- Minimize Data Dependency
  - data design goals
    - remove duplicated data, redundant paths
    - optimise table structure for the independent insertion..

  - minimization technique(ERM)
    - merge tables  1:1
    - link tables 1:M

## Modelling System behaviour

- state models represent behavior
  - state transition
- A **state transition diagram**
- A **transition table:**

- state machines
  - since modelling values as states in messy
  - too many possibilities

## Why worry about states?

- Need to consider states when you are thinking about testing

## Design process

- Design the look

- Design the data
- Design the processing
- check de* is sufficient
- Derive the test cases from processing mode

## Project Risks

- **Hazards**
  - likelihood:
  - severity:
- these determine the predicted impact of the risk.
- mitigate high impact risks

## Test Documentation

- Unit Tests
  - should be self-document

- System Tests

## Final Client Demo

- week11
- Be Professional
  - 3-5 slides "selling" your product
  - Live demonstration
  - Dress to impress
  - Q&A

## Summary

1. document design process
2. create and maintain a risk register
3. ensure tests - both unit and system with clear document
